# PathOfLowestCost
The objective of this App is to find the path of lowest cost when moving across a grid.

I developed UI to enter matrices. When the user is finished with entering the input matrice, a button is enabled to click on which displays the low cost path.

This app is developed using TDD approach. I have used XCTestFramework and wrote tests in conjuction with the code.

Please see the screenshots below to get an idea of how the app works.
